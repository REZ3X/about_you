# About You - The 1975

Part of the lyrics for the song "About You" by The 1975 that become my most favorite part:
```
		"And there was something about you that now I can't remember",
		"It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender",
		"And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning",
		"I never know what to think about",
		"I think about you",
		"About you"
```

## This is part of my C language learning journey though
